### CIS 554 Assignments
* HW1: Implement Doubly Linked-list, sort all nodes based on frequency in ascending order in-place

* HW2.Extra: Reverse the doubly linked-list which is sorted in frequency in-place

* HW2: Implement merge & remove without modifying values in Nodes. Sort Nodes IMMEDIATELY when merging & remove

* HW3: Implement STLs & overload operators to understand how they work. [Handout](https://github.com/bojms45/Syracuse-University/blob/master/CIS-554/Instruction_src/HW3.png)

* HW4: Define a class as generic type. Implement Copy & Move constructors, L & R values and initializer_list. All operations work on doubly linked-list

* HW5: Implement comparison functions (or functors) to allow map to sort elements

* HW6: Understanding smart pointer: shared pointer, weak_ptr, unique_ptr. [Handout](https://github.com/bojms45/Syracuse-University/blob/master/CIS-554/Instruction_src/HW6.pdf)

* HW7: Design a H-layout binary tree containinig 2n-1 nodes (n is number levels in the BT). [Handout](https://github.com/bojms45/Syracuse-University/blob/master/CIS-554/Instruction_src/HW7.pdf)

* HW8: Design of Data Structure using C++. Develop the design of the cards, deck, shuffle, and deal of the game of Battle Cards. [Handout](https://github.com/bojms45/Syracuse-University/blob/master/CIS-554/Instruction_src/HW8.pdf)
