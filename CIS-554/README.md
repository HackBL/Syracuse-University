CIS 554 Assignments
* HW1: Implement Doubly Linked-list, sort all nodes based on frequency in ascending order in-place
* HW2.Extra: Implement the functions reverse of the DoublyLinkedList class which is sorted in frequency in-place
* HW2: Implement merge & remove in-place. Not modifying values in Nodes. Not called sort function after merge, but do sort concurrently when merging each one
* HW3: Implement STL & overload operators to understand how they work
* HW4: Define a class as generic type. Implement Copy & Move constructors, L & R values and initializer_list. All operations work on doubly linked-list
* HW5: Implement comparison functions (or functors) to allow map to sort elements. Implement overload operator as well. 
* HW6: Understanding smart pointer: shared pointer, weak_ptr, unique_ptr
* HW7: A full complete binary tree contains 2n-1 nodes, where n is number levels in the binary tree. Given any n, generate the H-layout of the full complete binary tree.
* HW8: Data Structure Design using C++. Develop the design of the cards, deck, shuffle, and deal of the game of Battle Cards.
